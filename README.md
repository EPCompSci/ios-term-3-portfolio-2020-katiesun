# iOS Term 3 Portfolion 2020 - Katherine Sun

Hello, I'm Katherine Sun, and this is a portfolio for the apps and projects I have worked on during 2020. Starting in the second half of the 2019-20 school year, I began learning Swift in my high school's iOS App Development class. Building on the fundamental coding principles I learned from programming in Java and Swift, I gained exposure to Swift syntax and XCode formatting through online videos and research.

In the apps I've worked on thus far, I've experimented with timer functions, UI displays (stack views, segues, view controllers), receiving user input, and incorporating math-based functions. There is still much that I'd like to add and improve within these apps, so I would say this process is far from being done. However, it is a good start, and I believe it reflects my learning experience well. 

## Programming Experience
* Swift: Beginner/Intermediate (began early 2020)
* Java: Intermediate (began 2018)
* Python: Intermediate (began 2019, worked on several machine learning & statistical analysis projects)
* R/Rstudio: Intermediate (began 2019)

## Apps
### [Cypher Cipher](https://github.com/katiesun/Cypher-Cipher)
Cypher Cipher is the app I am currently working on. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages with ciphers like Caesar, Monoalphabetic, Affine, Hill, etc. As the app relies heavily on number theory, this app is challenging for its math-intensive programming. Additionally, there are many different options users have to encode their messages, so I played around with picker views and text fields a lot. My main goal for Cypher Cipher is to provide a centralized application for future Science Olympiad students in compiling cryptography questions and exams. 

### Pomodoro Timer 
Pomodoro Timer is based off of the famous Pomodoro studying technique. The app is minimal yet functional, as to best help students in focused studying.
